# Hello, Shreyas Battula Here <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width=30>

I’m an AI Engineer focused on building **agentic AI systems** that combine large language models, planning, and tool execution to solve real-world problems. My work spans **multi-agent architectures, LLM-powered copilots, and production-grade AI systems**, with strong foundations in distributed systems, reliability, and performance.

I’ve built and deployed autonomous agents for diagnostics, analytics, and multimodal reasoning across cloud and on-device environments, and I enjoy working at the intersection of **AI research, systems engineering, and product impact**.
